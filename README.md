A project to mimic the functionality of the pipe (the '|' character), in C
The "make" command will make an executable that can be used as such: "./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile" and will behave as the following command in bash: "< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile". Of course any valid commands and executables will be executed.
The "make bonus" command will make the same executable that will be able to execute as many commands as the system allows, or it can be executed as such: "./pipex here_doc LIMITER cmd cmd1 file" and will behave as the following command on bash "cmd << LIMITER | cmd1 >> file".
