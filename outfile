Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place$
And I can picture it after all these days$
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all$
I remember it all too well$
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team$
I remember it all too well, yeah$
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up$
I remember it all too well$
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise$
So casually cruel in the name of being honest$
'Cause I remember it all, all, all$
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah$
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well$
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all$
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all$
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well$
